# About Me

## Personal Information

My name is **Jamie Smith**. I'm a student at Dawson College in the *Electronics & Computer Engineering Technology* program.

One interesting fact about me: I built my first circuit when I was 10 years old!

## Programming Experience

I have experience with the following programming languages:

1. C/C++
2. Python
3. Arduino (technically C/C++)
4. Some JavaScript

### My Favorite Programming Language

My favorite programming language is **Python** because of its simplicity and versatility.

Here's a simple Python example:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    
hello_world()
```

And here's how I'd do the same in Arduino:

```arduino
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello, World!");
}

void loop() {
  // Nothing here
}
```
